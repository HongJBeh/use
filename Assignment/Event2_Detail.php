                <p>The Doraemon Exhibition Singapore 2023 makes its overseas debut at the National Museum of Singapore since its 2003 premiere in Japan.

Showcasing Doraemon through the lens of 28 leading contemporary Japanese artists and arts groups, the artworks on display respond to the theme of “Create Your Own Original Doraemon”.

Featuring distinctive artworks that capture the artists’ memories of Doraemon and their take on Japan’s beloved icon, the exhibition presents a diverse mix of ideas, mediums and techniques that include paintings, sculptures, graphics and photography. Two artworks by Singaporean artists are also exclusively presented as part of this showcase.

The Singapore edition of the exhibition also features a selection of the Fujiko F Fujio Museum’s prized drawings and sketches by the late Doraemon creator Mr Fujiko, in a rare feature titled “MANGA DORAEMON Original Drawings Exhibition”, specially showcased for the first time outside of Japan.

Visitors can also look forward to exciting complementary offerings including a pop-up café and a retail experience with limited edition Doraemon collectibles. Come revisit your memories of Doraemon and create new ones as well, and be inspired by the unlimited possibilities of the iconic character!</p>
